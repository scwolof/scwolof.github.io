# Ingredients
Dough:
* 200g plain flour
* 10g brown sugar
* 10g fresh yeast
* 140ml water
* 5g Salt

Sauce:
* 100ml olive oil
* 3 garlic cloves
* 5g brown sugar
* 10g dried oregano
* 400g plum tomato tin
* 10ml balsamic vinegar
* 2g salt
* 2g black pepper

Filling:
* 1 large red pepper
* 350g spinach
* 50g cheese
* 10g nutritional yeast

# Instructions
* Sift the flour, sugar, salt and yeast onto a clear work surface. Whisk the oil and water together in a bowl or jug. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and gradually add the water/oil. Use a whisk or fork to work the flour into the liquid, adding a little more liquid as you go until it forms a rough dough, you may not need all the water.
* Use your hands to work the dough into a rough ball shape and knead for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
* Oil a large bowl in it to coat. Cover with cling film and set aside in a warm place to rise for 1 hour.
* For the sauce, heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large heavy-based saucepan. Add a touch of salt, the sugar and herbs. Gently saut√© for a few minutes.
* Pour in the tomatoes and crush gently with the back of a spoon to break them up. Season and simmer for 20 minutes before adding the balsamic vinegar. Continue to simmer for 30-40 minutes or until thickened.
* For the filling, heat a large griddle pan and add the red pepper pieces to the pan, skin-side down, and cook until charred. Wrap immediately in cling film and allow to cool for around 10 minutes before peeling off the skin. Slice the pieces of pepper into even strips.
* Bring a saucepan of water to the boil and add the spinach. Gently wilt for about 5 minutes before removing with a slotted spoon and squeezing out any excess liquid. Transfer to a chopping board and mince to a pulp with a sharp knife. Season and set aside.
* Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto a clean surface and knock the air out by kneading it for a minute or two. Flour a large baking tray and press or roll the dough out into a rough square shape, leaving a little room around the edge of the tray. Now preheat your oven to the highest setting- about 250 Degrees.
* Spoon over the cooled sauce and spread, leaving an inch of bare dough at the top- this will make sealing the Stromboli easier.
* Distribute the spinach before dispersing the pepper strips evenly across the dough. At this stage you could also sprinkle over some grated vegan cheese or a little nutritional yeast.
* From the end closet to you, roll the Stromboli carefully away from you, tucking the seam under when you reach the top. Move the Stromboli diagonally across the baking sheet so it has room to expand and score the top with floured knife.
* Bake for 15 minutes or until completely crisp and golden before transferring to a serving board.
